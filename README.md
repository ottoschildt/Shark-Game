# Shark-Game
This is my first game, created with C# Visual Studio in programming course at University of Jyväskylä

In the game you have to grow as big as you can by eating all the divers and destroying boats. You must avoid hitting plastic objects, becouse you will lose points and your size then. 

You can move Shark up and down with W and S buttons.
